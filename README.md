# Synchronous FIFO (Verilog)

This project implements a **parameterizable Synchronous FIFO** design in Verilog along with a fully functional testbench for simulation.  
It is intended for learning, verification practice, and demonstrating RTL design skills for VLSI roles.

## 🚀 Features

- Fully synchronous FIFO with single clock input  
- Parameterized **DATA_WIDTH** and **FIFO_DEPTH**  
- Clean RTL architecture using write/read pointers  
- Overflow & underflow protection  
- Status signals:
  - `full`
  - `empty`
- Testbench includes:
  - Reset sequence
  - Write/read stimulus
  - Boundary condition testing
  - Simulation wave verification
